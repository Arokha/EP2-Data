    "description": "<p>This common freighter and passenger vessel can be found on regular routes between every large habitat and inhabited planet and moon in the Solar System. These are modern fusiondrive ships that offer fast and comfortable travel for passengers and some cargo. Similar in design to bulk carriers, transports trade off cargo module room for multiple passenger compartments mounted on 90-meter-long booms that can extend and rotate at 2 rpm to simulate Mars gravity.</p>",
