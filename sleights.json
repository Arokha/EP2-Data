Because the illusion is unsubstantial, it also may not stop or start movement, hold weight, provide protection, etc. If the target carefully examines the illusion or physically interacts with it, they receive an INT Check to see through it. Likewise, if the illusion in any way defies reality or inspires common-sense incredulity, or the real world interferes with the illusion (sudden loud noises, walls hidden by the illusion impede movement, etc.), the target gets an INT Check to disbelieve. Targets that succeed in their INT Check will still faintly experience the illusory input, but recognize it as unreal. No check is needed if the target has proof the illusion is false. Complex or lengthy illusions are hard to sustain; the GM may call for INT Checks or appropriate skill tests to maintain the constructed facade.</p><p>Illusions require intense mental power to sustain.
