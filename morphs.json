Octomorphs typically crawl along in zero gravity using their arm suckers and expelling air for propulsion; in low gravity they walk on two of their arms. Their eyes have been enhanced with color vision, provide a 360-degree field of vision, and rotationally adjust to keep the slit-shaped pupil aligned with “up.” A transgenic vocal system allows them to speak.",
