The attacker's superior successes can be used to apply a cumulative -10 modifier to these checks. Additional shots can be used to apply more layers to a trapped target (each requiring a SOM Check to break free). The foam allows characters to breathe even if their mouth and nose are covered, but it may impede sight. Freezer foam can be spiked with contact toxins or drugs to additionally incapacitate the target. It can also be used to construct temporary barricades or cover (creating moderate cover for 1 person per shot). Hardened foam has an Armor of 5/10 and Durability of 20.

    "description": "<p>Railguns slide and accelerate a non-explosive conductive tungsten slug along electromagnetic rails at extremely high velocities (Mach 6+) to create an overwhelming, penetrating attack. The kinetic energy of the projectile exceeds that of an explosive-filled shell of greater mass and creates shock and heat waves upon impact that shatter and incinerate the target, or portions of it. While railguns are more potent than firearms, they cannot use smart or specialty ammunition as the projectile must be conductive and able to survive both acceleration and heat created in the process due to friction. Nanofabrication allows railguns to be manufactured on the personal-weapons scale while high-energy portable batteries provide the power to fire them. Railgun operation makes no flash and is silent except for the supersonic crack of the projectile. </p><p>Railguns are available in the same models as firearms. They are equipped with standard and nuclear batteries just like beam weapons, holding enough power for 200 shots.</p>",
